Hi Humans! 

Hubot here. I like ndoafb and anskfcsdnjef (that's what I'm made of!). (<- two forms of sentence ending punctuation)
I've had tacos on the moon (they were Vegan of course!). (<-Again two different forms of sentence ending punctuation) <- and now none at all....
and find them far superior to Earth tacos!!!
